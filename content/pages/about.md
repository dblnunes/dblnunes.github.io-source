Hello World! 

My name is Daniel Nunes.  

Im currently undergoing a career change. From Health and Fitness Coach to Data Scientist.
This blog is the account of my learnings. Here I will publish the projects I will be developing and share my journey to become a proficient Data Scientist. It's an opportunity to assimilate the knowledge and to develop thinking and comunication skills that are essential in Data Science.

Hope you enjoy!
