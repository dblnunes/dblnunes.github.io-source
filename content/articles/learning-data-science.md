Summary: I have decided to make a career change. Nowadays one has to be a lifelong learner and be able to adapt and change career more often than ever. As an up and coming popular subject Data Science appeals to me because it deals with many different skills that I always felt inclined to develop and pursue. Here I outline my path to learn the skills necessary to become a Data Scientist.



I have decided to make a career change.  

Data Science appeals to me because it deals with many different skills that I always felt inclined to develop and pursue. Here I outline my path to learn the skills necessary to become a Data Scientist.

Out of curiosity I started learning how to code with Python. Initially I started taking a few courses and using Google and StackOverflow to learn what I needed. Life got in the way and my interest started fading and I stoped eventually. I picked it up again when I started reading books on data and AI, and decided to apply it to data analysis. Learning Python was now more engaging because I had a context to apply it to. I've been using Python mainly for data analysis. I can spend hours focused on trying to figure a piece of code or an approach I can use to take insights from data.

My goal is to develop the skills necessary for data analysis and then develop more in depth understanding of machine learning algorithms that can be used for analysis and prediction capable of informing decision-making.  

####Self-Learning

I have started my own learning and development path by designing my own open sourced data science curriculum. In this first post I outline the topics i will focus on for the next 6 months. In future posts I'll talk about my approach to learning and the curriculum resources and tools I will use. 

I started with an exploratory phase where I just took several entry-level data science courses, focusing on the programming component. Im currently involved in learning Python for data science and looking to start on R and SQL later on.  

The next phase will cover the fundamental math and theoretical requisites to succeed in data science and machine learning: linear algebra, statistics, probability and calculus.  

I will then spend time practicing with datasets that interest me. I've spent many years in the Sports, Health and Fitness industry and i believe I can use data scientist skills to inform decision making at different levels in these arenas.

Bellow is an outline of the topics i will be focusing my learning. This is a general overview of the topics. I understand that there are many nuances depending on the specific directions one can take. 

**Stay tuned for future posts where I'll share my motivation for a career in Data Science, my approach to learning and more specific breakdown of the curriculum and the tools and resources to be used.** 

##_Exploration
  
  
This is the phase I've just completed.
It was a chance to understand the scope of the Data Science and Machine Learning world and what acquiring the knowledge and developing the skills will entail. 

A few topics I covered in the courses I took and the books I read during this period:

- Python basics
- Python packages: Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Time series analysis
- Financial analysis
- Version control, Git, use of the Terminal
- Statistics

##_Programming I- Data Analysis Using Python
