Summary: I have decided to make a career change. Nowadays one has to be a lifelong learner and be able to adapt and change career more often than ever. As an up and coming popular subject Data Science appeals to me because it deals with many different skills that I always felt inclined to develop and pursue. Here I outline my path to learn the skills necessary to become a Data Analyst and Scientist.



I have decided to make a career change. Nowadays one has to be a lifelong learner and be able to adapt and change career more often than ever. As an up and coming popular subject Data Science appeals to me because it deals with many different skills that I always felt inclined to develop and pursue. Here I outline my path to learn the skills necessary to become a Data Analyst and Scientist.

Out of curiosity I started learning how to code with Python. Initially i started taking a few courses and using Google and StackOverflow to learn what I needed. Life got in the way and my interest started fading and i stoped eventually. I piked it up again when I started reading books on data, algorithms and AI, and decided to apply it to data analysis. My Python learning was a lot easier because now I had a context to apply it to and i was super motivated to pursue it. No other subject has excited me as much as Data Science. I can spend hours focused on trying to figure a piece of code or an approach i can use to take insights from data. And i'm just starting!

My goal is to develop the skills necessary for data analysis and then develop more in depth understanding of machine learning algorithms that can be used for analysis and prediction capable of informing decision-making. I have started my own learning and development path by designing my own open sourced data science learning. In this first post i outline the topics i will focus on for the next 6 months. In future posts I'll talk about my approach to learning and the curriculum resources and tools I will use. 

I started with an exploratory phase where I just took several entry-level data science courses, focusing on the programming component. Im currently involved in learning Python for data science and looking to start on R and SQL later on.  

The next phase will cover the fundamental math and theoretical requisites to succeed in data science and machine learning: linear algebra, statistics, probability and calculus.  

I will then spend time practicing with datasets that interest me. I've spent many years in the Sports, Health and Fitness industry and i believe I can use data scientist skills to inform decision making at different levels.

Bellow is an outline of the topics i will be focusing my learning and a rough time estimate for each phase of the plan. This is a general overview of the topics. I understand that there are many nuances depending on the specific directions one can take.

Stay tuned for future posts where I'll share my motivation for a career in Data Science, my approach to learning and more specific breakdown of the curriculum and the tools and resources to be used. 

##_Exploration (March)
  
  
This is the phase I've just completed.
It was a chance to understand at a higher level what comprises the field of Data Science and Machine Learning and what learning the knowledge and developing the skills will entail. 

A few topics i covered in the courses I took and the books i read during this period:

- Python set up and basic programming
- Python packages: Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Time series analysis
- Version control, Git, use of the Terminal
- Statistics

##_Fundamentals I- Data Analysis Using Python (March, April)

Collect, explore, clean, manipulate and visualize data

Using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn packages for:  

- Data Loading 
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data Wrangling 
- Data Visualisation

Databases:

- SQL

##_Fundamentals II - Math (April, May, June)

- Linear Algebra  
- Statistics
- Probability
- Calculus
- Algorithms


##_Machine Learning (May,June,July)

- Scikit-learn
- Linear Regression
- Bias-Variance Trade-Off
- Logistic Regression
- K-nearest Neighbours
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering

##_Deep Learning (August, September)

- Neural Networks
- TensorFlow

##_Applied Practice (May-October)

- Choose interesting datasets to use for projects (health and fitness, finance and sports performance are the areas that I will be looking at)
- Enter competitions (Kaggle, DrivenData)
- Write detailed articles of the projects I develop
